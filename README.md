The vb.net application "desktop noodle" provides an unlimited number of desktops for Windows, each with it's own folder. It saves icon positions and keeps up with screen resolution, too. Cut, copy, and paste files between desktops. Use a different desktop for each project and group subject matter into different desktops.

The release is a single exe file for 64bit Windows. Place the file in a good location and double-click to run. Windows will request permission to download .Net 4.8 if not already installed.  Use is intuitive and needs no description.
